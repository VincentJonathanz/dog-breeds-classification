# Dog Breed Classification With Computer Vision

As a humans, it easy for us to distinguish 10–20 popular dog breeds from another.But when it comes to over 100 types of dogs,for a human to correctly and consistently classify a large number of breeds, we need a different approach than just pure memorization.We need to start extracting “features” that correspond to different breeds such as ear shape, facial shape, tail length, fur color etc. Even then, we need to memorize what breed has what features, and it’s not an easy or fun task.

### Problem
Since that task is really difficult for human, this is where computer come into play.
Computer will help us to do Multi-class image classification to classify a different dog breed.

Multi-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in automatically adding information to their listings.

In this project we're going to predict dog breeds from images with computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The main tools we use:
1. `TensorFlow` for preprocessing our data
2. `TensorFlow Hub` for transfer learning.
