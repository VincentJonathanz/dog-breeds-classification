# Dog Breed Classification With Computer Vision
<img src=./My-dog-photo/custom-preds.png width=1080>

As humans, it is easy for us to distinguish between 10-20 popular dog breeds from each other. However, when it comes to over 100 types of dogs, it is difficult for a human to correctly and consistently classify a large number of breeds using only pure memorization. We need to start extracting features that correspond to different breeds, such as ear shape, facial shape, tail length, fur color, etc. Even then, we need to memorize what breed has what features, and it is not an easy or fun task.

### Problem
Since that task is really difficult for humans, this is where computers come into play. Computers can help us to do multi-class image classification to classify different dog breeds.

Multi-class image classification is an important problem because it is the same kind of technology that Tesla uses in their self-driving cars or Airbnb uses in automatically adding information to their listings.

In this project, we are going to predict dog breeds from images with computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The main tools we will use are:

1. 'TensorFlow' for preprocessing our data
2. 'TensorFlow Hub' for transfer learning
